# Move Your VMWare Workloads to Nomad
![Move Your VMWare Workloads to Nomad](docs/images/Nomad_PrimaryLogo_FullColor.png)

This repository contains a slide deck (in the docs directory), as well as sample config files for running HashiCorp Nomad with the KVM/QEMU driver. This allows you to run unmodified VMWare disk images (VMDK files) on a Nomad cluster. Get all the benefits of a modern workload scheduler, even if you have legacy apps that can't be put into containers!
